If you like my work or have used any of my projects, a small contribution would be very much appreciated to keep my open-source projects going. Donations help me cover the cost of coffee for the time spent creating stuff. You can either buy my apps from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Pool-Of-Tears) or use any of the following mediums below:
